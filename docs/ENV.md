# Environment variables

The single source of truth for every runtime + build-time knob Casual
Sheets reads. The admin panel (lands in v0.1.0) reads this doc to
render its config UI; `docs/DOCKERHUB.md` and the site self-hosting
section both link here.

Two flavours:

- **Runtime** — read by the Node server at startup or per-request.
  Settable via `docker run -e`, the `environment:` block in
  `docker-compose.yml`, or `--env-file`.
- **Build-time** — read by Vite during `pnpm --filter @sheet/web
  build` and baked into the frontend bundle. Setting these at runtime
  does nothing; pass them as `--build-arg` on `docker build` or via
  the `args:` block of `docker-compose.yml` to bake your own image.

## Server (runtime)

| Var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3000` | HTTP + WebSocket listen port. The single port the image exposes. |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address. `0.0.0.0` exposes to the network; `127.0.0.1` keeps it localhost-only. |
| `REDIS_URL` | _unset_ | Redis connection string for Y.Doc persistence (rooms survive server restarts with a 7-day TTL). Unset → in-memory only; rooms vanish on restart. Compose pattern: `redis://redis:6379`. |
| `ROOM_TTL_MIN` | `15` | Minutes a room stays in memory after the last client disconnects. Lower → quicker eviction (less idle memory); higher → friendlier reconnect after a short drop. |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | `100` | Hard cap on multipart + raw-binary uploads. Bounds the share-room seed (`.xlsx`) and snapshot (gzipped JSON) upload paths. Raise for users with workbooks above this — and bump `VITE_MAX_OPEN_MB` to match so the browser doesn't post something the server will 413. |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` _(in image)_ | Standard Node mode. Set by the Dockerfile; rarely overridden. |

---

## Storage (runtime · landing in v0.1.0)

Reserved keys for the WOPI host-integration MVP. Currently no-op
on `main`; documented here so operators can plan ahead.

| Var | Accepted | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CASUAL_STORAGE` | `memory` _(default)_ · `local` · `s3` · `postgres` | Selects the WOPI backend. `memory` keeps today's no-DB shape. The other three persist workbooks across restarts. |
| `CASUAL_LOCAL_PATH` | `/data` | Filesystem root when `CASUAL_STORAGE=local`. Mount with `-v ./workbooks:/data`. |
| `CASUAL_S3_ENDPOINT` | _unset_ | S3-API endpoint when `CASUAL_STORAGE=s3`. Examples: `https://s3.amazonaws.com`, `http://minio:9000`, `https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`. |
| `CASUAL_S3_REGION` | `us-east-1` | S3 region. Required by AWS S3; safe to keep at default for MinIO / R2 / B2. |
| `CASUAL_S3_BUCKET` | _unset_ | Bucket name. |
| `CASUAL_S3_ACCESS_KEY` | _unset_ | S3 access key. Treat as secret. |
| `CASUAL_S3_SECRET_KEY` | _unset_ | S3 secret key. Treat as secret. |
| `CASUAL_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` | `false` | Set `true` for MinIO and some self-hosted S3 implementations that require path-style addressing. |
| `CASUAL_PG_URL` | _unset_ | Postgres connection string when `CASUAL_STORAGE=postgres`. Format: `postgres://user:pass@host:port/db`. |

---

## Networking (runtime · landing in v0.1.0)

Reserved keys for the admin-panel networking surface. Currently no-op
on `main`.

| Var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CASUAL_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | _detected_ | The public URL the server should report in redirects, WOPI `BaseFileName`, share-link generation, OG canonical URLs. Example: `https://sheets.acme.example.com`. |
| `CASUAL_CORS_ORIGINS` | _empty (same-origin only)_ | Comma-separated origins that may call the API. Empty → same-origin only. Example: `https://app.acme.example.com,https://staging.acme.example.com`. |
| `CASUAL_TRUST_PROXY` | `loopback` | Which proxy hops we accept `X-Forwarded-*` from. `false` to disable; `true` to trust the immediate upstream; a list of IPs / subnets for explicit allowlisting. |
| `CASUAL_HSTS_MAX_AGE` | _unset_ | Emit `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<value>` when set. Only set if HTTPS terminates upstream — sending HSTS over HTTP locks users out. |

---

## Admin (runtime · v0.1.0)

The admin panel at `/admin` is gated by env-driven credentials. Set
`CASUAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` + `CASUAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to enable; the
panel POSTs them to `/api/admin/login` which constant-time-compares
against env and mints a short-lived admin-role JWT for the session.
`CASUAL_JWT_SECRET` must also be set (≥ 16 chars) so the session
token can be signed.

| Var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CASUAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` | _unset (panel disabled)_ | Operator login username for the admin panel. Compared constant-time against `/api/admin/login` body. |
| `CASUAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | _unset (panel disabled)_ | Operator login password. Treat as secret. |
| `CASUAL_ADMIN_SESSION_TTL` | `3600` | Admin session JWT lifetime in seconds. |
| `CASUAL_ADMIN_CONFIG_PATH` | `/data/casual-admin.json` | Filesystem path where the admin panel persists its JSON config (branding, storage, networking, room limits, auth-hook config, base path, webhook subscriptions). Atomically written with mode 0600 — treat the file as a secret. |

### Admin REST endpoints

| Path | Method | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/admin/status` | GET | public | `{ configured: bool }` — bootstrap probe for the panel. |
| `/api/admin/login` | POST | env creds | Returns `{ token, ttl_seconds, username }`. Token is an admin-role JWT. |
| `/api/admin/config` | GET | admin JWT | Current config; secret fields redacted to `***`. |
| `/api/admin/config` | PUT | admin JWT | Patch-merge the on-disk config. Secret fields sent as `***` keep the prior value. |

### Admin config — runtime overrides

The on-disk config persisted at `CASUAL_ADMIN_CONFIG_PATH` overrides
env at runtime. Env provides the bootstrap floor; the admin panel
writes win once set. Fields:

- **branding** — `appName`, `accentColor`, `logoUrl`
- **basePath** — reverse-proxy mount path (e.g. `/sheets`); empty
  means served at root. Affects Fastify route prefix + the SPA's
  asset base.
- **storage** — `backend` (`memory` | `local` | `s3` | `postgres`)
  + per-backend creds. Mirrors the `CASUAL_STORAGE` env above.
- **networking** — `publicOrigin`, `corsOrigins`, `trustProxy`,
  `hstsMaxAge`. Mirrors the networking env vars.
- **limits** — `maxRooms`, `maxFileSizeMb`, `roomTtlMin`,
  `maxUsersPerRoom`.
- **auth** — OIDC / SAML / JWT provider config (OIDC + SAML stub
  in v0.1; JWT actively wired).
- **webhooks** — array of `{ name, url, events, secret, enabled }`
  subscriptions. See _Webhooks_ below.

---

## Webhooks (runtime · v0.1.0)

Server-side events fire HTTP POSTs to operator-configured URLs.
HMAC-SHA256 signs the JSON body when a subscription has a `secret`
— receivers verify via the `X-Casual-Signature: sha256=<hex>`
header.

Subscriptions live in `admin-config.webhooks` (writable via the
admin panel). Each subscription:

```json
{
  "name": "audit-log",
  "url": "https://example.com/hooks/casual",
  "events": ["file.saved", "admin.login"],
  "secret": "shh",
  "enabled": true
}
```

Empty `events` array = subscribed to every event.

### Events

| Event | Fired when |
|---|---|
| `room.created` | `POST /api/rooms` creates a new room |
| `room.dropped` | Last client leaves + GC ticks (after `roomTtlMin`) |
| `file.uploaded` | `POST /api/rooms/:id/seed` succeeds |
| `file.saved` | `POST /wopi/files/:id/contents` succeeds (download → edit → save flow) |
| `file.deleted` | `DELETE /wopi/files/:id` (admin only) |
| `user.joined` | New client joins a room |
| `user.left` | Client disconnects from a room |
| `admin.login` | Successful `/api/admin/login` |
| `admin.login_failed` | Failed `/api/admin/login` |

### Payload shape

```json
{
  "event": "file.saved",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-01T14:23:09.123Z",
  "payload": {
    "fileId": "wb-q3-budget",
    "size": 12345,
    "version": "1748872989123-abc12345",
    "user": "alice@acme.example"
  }
}
```

Headers on every dispatch:

| Header | Description |
|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `User-Agent` | `CasualSheets-Webhook/0.1` |
| `X-Casual-Event` | The event name |
| `X-Casual-Attempt` | `1` or `2` — see retry policy below |
| `X-Casual-Signature` | `sha256=<hex>` when subscription has a secret. Compute the same way to verify: `hmac-sha256(secret, raw_body)`. |

### Retry policy (v0.1)

- Single retry on non-2xx response or network error.
- Retry fires after 5 s.
- After 2 attempts, the dispatch is logged + dropped. v0.2 adds a
  proper queue with exponential back-off + a dead-letter store.

## Auth (runtime · JWT access tokens · v0.1.0)

When `CASUAL_JWT_SECRET` is set, every `/wopi/files/*` request must
carry a valid JWT (in `Authorization: Bearer …` or via the
`?access_token=…` query string — WOPI's standard placement). When
unset, WOPI routes fall through to v0.0.x anonymous-by-URL behaviour
— operators opt in to auth by setting the secret.

| Var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CASUAL_JWT_SECRET` | _unset (auth disabled)_ | HMAC-SHA256 shared secret used to sign + verify access tokens. Minimum 16 chars; recommend ≥ 32 random bytes (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`). Treat as secret. |
| `CASUAL_JWT_DEFAULT_TTL` | `3600` | Default token lifetime in seconds when `ttl_seconds` is omitted from the `POST /api/tokens` body. |

### Token claims (signed payload)

| Claim | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sub` | string | Username, email, or any stable user identifier. Surfaces as `UserId` in CheckFileInfo. |
| `file_id` | string | The single file this token authorises. WOPI routes reject when the URL `:id` ≠ this claim. |
| `role` | `'admin' \| 'editor' \| 'commenter' \| 'viewer'` | Coarse role. Default permission map applied unless `permissions` overrides. |
| `permissions` | object _(optional)_ | Per-flag override: `{ read, write, comment, download, share, admin }`. |
| `features` | object _(optional)_ | Feature toggles consumed by the client UI: `{ charts, pivots, conditionalFormatting, sharing, exportFiles, collab, ai }`. |
| `password_required` | boolean _(optional)_ | When true, the legacy `x-room-password` header gate also applies on top of the JWT. |
| `display_name` | string _(optional)_ | Human label for presence + cursor markers. Falls back to `sub`. |
| `aud` | string _(optional)_ | Audience — typically the deployment's public origin. |
| `iss` | string _(optional)_ | Issuer — useful when downstream SSO mints tokens. |
| `exp`, `iat` | number | Standard JWT expiry + issued-at, set by the signer. |

### Endpoints exposed when JWT is configured

| Path | Method | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/me` | GET | optional | Decodes the token + returns resolved role / permissions / features / `passwordRequired` / `exp`. Returns `{ anonymous: true }` without a token. |
| `/api/tokens` | POST | admin role required | Mint a new token. Body: `{ sub, file_id, role, permissions?, features?, password_required?, display_name?, ttl_seconds?, aud?, iss? }`. Returns the signed JWT + the resolved claim summary. |
| `/api/files` | GET | admin role required | List every file id the host backend knows about. |

### Bootstrapping the first admin token

Tokens are minted by tokens — chicken-and-egg. Sign the first admin
token manually using the secret:

```sh
docker compose exec app node -e '
  import("jsonwebtoken").then(({ default: jwt }) => {
    const tok = jwt.sign(
      { sub: "owner", file_id: "*", role: "admin" },
      process.env.CASUAL_JWT_SECRET,
      { algorithm: "HS256", expiresIn: "8h" },
    );
    console.log(tok);
  });
'
```

After that, the admin panel (v0.1.0) issues subsequent tokens through
its UI; the bootstrap step happens once per deployment.

## Web build (Vite — bake-time only)

These are read at `pnpm --filter @sheet/web build` and bundled into
the JS. Override via `--build-arg`. Setting them at runtime does
nothing.

| Var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_COLLAB_ENABLED` | `1` | Ship co-editing in the bundle. Off in the GitHub Pages demo build; on in the Docker image. |
| `VITE_COLLAB_WS_URL` | _same-origin `/yjs`_ | WebSocket URL the collab driver dials. Override when running Vite dev (`:5273`) against a standalone server (`:3000`). |
| `VITE_MAX_OPEN_MB` | `100` | Hard reject for File → Open / drag-drop. Larger files freeze and eventually OOM-crash the tab during the ExcelJS parse. The supported sweet spot is 25–50 MB. |
| `VITE_SOFT_WARN_MB` | `25` | Threshold above which the loading overlay shows the up-front "this is a large workbook, may take 10+ s" hint. Should be ≤ `VITE_MAX_OPEN_MB`. |

---

## OCI image-label build args

Passed by `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` at tag-time. Surface
as `org.opencontainers.image.*` labels on the published image so
operators can `docker inspect` provenance.

| Build arg | Sets label | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CASUAL_VERSION` | `image.version` | The git tag, e.g. `v0.1.0`. |
| `CASUAL_GIT_SHA` | `image.revision` | Full commit SHA at the tag. |
| `CASUAL_BUILD_DATE` | `image.created` | RFC 3339 UTC timestamp at build time. |

Inspect with:

```sh
docker inspect schnsrw/casual-sheets:latest \
  | jq '.[0].Config.Labels | with_entries(select(.key | startswith("org.opencontainers")))'
```

---

## Discovery convention

- **Server** keys use snake-case (`PORT`, `ROOM_TTL_MIN`) for backwards
  compatibility with the v0.0.x release line.
- **Storage / networking / admin** keys (v0.1.0+) all carry the
  `CASUAL_` prefix so they're greppable and don't collide with
  generic env vars on a shared host.

If you're adding a new runtime knob, follow the `CASUAL_*` convention
and update this file in the same commit. The admin panel auto-renders
its config UI from this table.
