/**
 * CasualSheetsAPI — the imperative ref handed to a host via `<CasualSheets onReady>`.
 *
 * This is the SDK's stable integration surface (Excalidraw's model: props +
 * imperative ref). Hosts drive the editor through these methods rather than
 * reaching into Univer directly; `api.univer` is the documented escape hatch and
 * is explicitly NOT covered by semver — everything else here is.
 *
 * Surface:
 *   getSnapshot / loadSnapshot / getSelection / executeCommand / setTheme /
 *   importXlsx / univer
 *
 * `importXlsx` lazy-loads the parser via `import('@casualoffice/sheets/xlsx')`
 * — a BARE subpath, not a relative `import('../xlsx')`. The main tsup config is
 * `splitting:false`, so a relative dynamic import would be inlined and balloon
 * the editor entry from ~24KB to ~200KB of ExcelJS for hosts that never open a
 * file. The subpath is externalised in tsup.config.ts so it stays a separate
 * chunk the consumer code-splits.
 *
 * Deferred to a later, clearly-scoped batch (kept off the type until it works,
 * so the surface never advertises a method that throws):
 *   - exportXlsx — needs the export converter lifted out of apps/web first (the
 *     SDK xlsx module is import-only today); next batch.
 *
 * `attachCollab` is NOT a method here — it ships as a standalone
 * `attachCollab(api, opts)` on the `@casualoffice/sheets/collab` subpath so the
 * editor stays collab-unaware (and collab-free in the bundle) until opted in.
