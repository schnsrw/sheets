/**
 * CasualSheetsAPI — the imperative ref handed to a host via `<CasualSheets onReady>`.
 *
 * This is the SDK's stable integration surface (Excalidraw's model: props +
 * imperative ref). Hosts drive the editor through these methods rather than
 * reaching into Univer directly; `api.univer` is the documented escape hatch and
 * is explicitly NOT covered by semver — everything else here is.
 *
 * Scope of THIS batch (SDK restructure, Phase 1 step 3):
 *   getSnapshot / loadSnapshot / getSelection / executeCommand / univer
 *
 * Deferred to later, clearly-scoped batches (kept off the type until they work,
 * so the surface never advertises a method that throws):
 *   - importXlsx / exportXlsx — the xlsx I/O batch. importXlsx must NOT be a
 *     plain `import('../xlsx')` here: the main tsup config is `splitting:false`,
 *     so a dynamic import gets inlined and balloons the editor entry from ~11KB
 *     to ~200KB of parser code for hosts that never open a file. The xlsx-I/O
 *     batch wires it as its own chunk (and lifts the export converter out of
 *     apps/web — the SDK xlsx module is import-only today).
 *   - setTheme    — runtime light/dark switch needs IThemeService wiring + a
 *     dark theme bundle; the `theme` prop covers mount-time theming for now.
 *   - attachCollab — belongs to the storage/collab adapter phase (Phase 2);
 *     the editor ships collab-unaware until then.
