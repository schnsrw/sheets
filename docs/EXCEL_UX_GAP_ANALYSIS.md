# Excel UX Gap Analysis

This document tracks how close `casual-sheets` feels to Excel for a normal user.

It is intentionally practical:

- What a normal Excel user expects
- What we already have
- What is missing
- What feels different from Excel
- What should be fixed first

Evidence is based on the current codebase and E2E coverage, especially:

- `tests/e2e/excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/excel-shortcuts.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/excel-shortcuts-polish.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/paste-from-excel.spec.ts`
- related E2E suites for charts, pivots, tables, formula bar, print, xlsx round-trip, and co-editing

## Summary

The product is already strong on core spreadsheet interaction:

- grid editing
- formula bar
- sheet navigation
- selection
- formatting basics
- sort/filter/table/pivot/chart flows
- xlsx import/export
- print/page setup

The earlier Excel-fit gaps in this document have largely been closed.
The remaining single-user work is now concentrated in a much smaller set:

1. flash fill
2. residual keyboard-focus polish that shows up in real usage rather than in the main shortcut set
3. any last-mile ODS or clipboard edge cases uncovered by broader real-world files

After that, the next major lane is co-editing.

## Definition Of Done

For this document, “Excel-familiar” does not mean “clone every Excel feature.”
It means a normal Excel user can open the app and, within the first few minutes:

- open an existing workbook without confusion
- navigate with expected shortcuts
- paste from Excel without obvious damage
- find common formatting commands in expected places
- recover familiar modal workflows for `Ctrl+1`, `Ctrl+G`, and function insertion
- stay oriented when moving between grid, formula bar, ribbon, menus, and dialogs

That bar is met when:

- the first-run workflows above are covered by stable E2E tests
- the top shortcut gaps are no longer `fixme`
- clipboard and formatting behavior no longer feel “web-app different”
- a user does not need product-specific knowledge to finish common Excel tasks

## Current Validation Status

Latest local full E2E run:

- `297 passed`
- `15 skipped`
- `0 failed`

The skipped cases mostly represent known Excel-parity gaps tracked below.

## Rating

High-level fit for a normal Excel user:

- Core editing/navigation: strong
- Formatting workflows: moderate
- Data-entry shortcuts: strong
- Advanced desktop-Excel affordances: partial
- External paste/import muscle-memory: partial
- Command discoverability: partial

Overall:

- Good spreadsheet UX
- Not yet full Excel-familiar UX

## UX / Feature Gaps That Will Stand Out to Excel Users

| Feature / UX | Current status | Evidence | User impact | Difficulty | Priority | Recommended fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Paste from desktop Excel with high fidelity | Missing / partial | `tests/e2e/paste-from-excel.spec.ts` has `fixme` cases | Very high | Medium | P0 | Preserve values, bold headers, merges, and `x:fmla` formulas from Excel HTML clipboard |
| `Ctrl+1` Format Cells dialog | Missing | `excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts` `test.fixme('Ctrl+1 ...')` | Very high | Medium | P0 | Add Number / Alignment / Font / Border / Fill tabs; start compact |
| `Ctrl+G` Go To | Missing | `excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts` `test.fixme('Ctrl+G ...')` | High | Low | P0 | Focus Name Box first; later add true Go To dialog |
| Insert Function dialog (`Shift+F3`) | Missing | `excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts` | High | Medium | P1 | Searchable function picker with category + description |
| Function argument helper (`Ctrl+Shift+A`) | Missing | `excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts` | High | Medium | P1 | Show argument tooltip / insertion helper while editing formulas |
| Paste formatting only (`Ctrl+Shift+V`) | Missing | `excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts` | High | Medium | P1 | Add Paste Special path and menu exposure |
| Multi-range selection mode (`Shift+F8`) | Missing | `excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts` | Medium | Medium | P1 | Support additive non-adjacent range selection |
| Re-apply filter (`Ctrl+Alt+L`) | Missing | `excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts` | Medium | Low | P2 | Re-run current filter model over range |
| Flash Fill (`Ctrl+E`) | Missing | `excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts` | Medium | High | P2 | Start with simple pattern-based fill for common cases |
| Keyboard context menu (`Shift+F10`) | Missing | `excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts` | Medium | Low | P2 | Open current cell/range context menu from keyboard |
| Ribbon/grid focus transfer (`Ctrl+F6`) | Missing | `excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts` | Medium | Medium | P2 | Formalize focus zones and cycling order |
| Search / Tell Me (`Alt+Q`) | Missing | `excel-shortcut-coverage.spec.ts` | Medium | Medium | P3 | Add command palette / action search |
| AutoFilter state is not exposed cleanly | Partial | `Ctrl+Shift+L` currently smoke-tested, not deep-asserted | Medium | Medium | P2 | Provide stable filter read model / UI signal for tests and UX |

## Implementation Map

These are the likely code touchpoints for the highest-value parity fixes. They are not hard constraints, but they are the shortest path through the current codebase.

| Gap | Primary code touchpoints | Why here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| External Excel paste fidelity | `apps/web/src/univer/paste-merge-hook.ts`, `tests/e2e/paste-from-excel.spec.ts` | this is where HTML clipboard normalization and merge handling already live |
| `Ctrl+1` Format Cells | `apps/web/src/shell/MenuBar.tsx`, `apps/web/src/shell/RibbonControls.tsx`, `apps/web/src/shell/PropertiesDialog.tsx` or a new `FormatCellsDialog.tsx` | keyboard wiring exists in menu/ribbon command handling; dialog can reuse existing format controls |
| `Ctrl+G` Go To | `apps/web/src/shell/FormulaBar.tsx`, `apps/web/src/shell/MenuBar.tsx`, `tests/e2e/formula-bar.spec.ts` | the Name Box already exists, so the first step is likely focus and selection behavior rather than a net-new subsystem |
| Insert Function / argument helper | `apps/web/src/shell/formula-functions.ts`, `apps/web/src/shell/FormulaBar.tsx`, `tests/e2e/formula-picker.spec.ts` | formula discovery UX already has a partial surface to extend |
| Paste Special / formatting-only paste | `apps/web/src/univer/paste-merge-hook.ts`, `apps/web/src/shell/MenuBar.tsx`, `apps/web/src/shell/file-menu.ts` | paste routing plus command exposure need to align |
| Multi-range selection | selection hooks in `apps/web/src/hooks/`, keyboard handling in `apps/web/src/shell/MenuBar.tsx`, targeted E2E coverage | requires both state-model and keyboard-mode behavior |
| Keyboard context menu / focus-zone navigation | `apps/web/src/shell/MenuBar.tsx`, `apps/web/src/shell/Toolbar.tsx`, `apps/web/src/shell/FormulaBar.tsx`, dialog focus handling | this is mostly focus architecture, not data-model work |

## Features a Normal Excel User Commonly Uses That Are Not There Yet

This is the practical missing list, not the entire Excel feature surface.

| Feature | Present? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Go To (`Ctrl+G`) | No | Name Box exists, but Excel-style Go To flow does not |
| Format Cells dialog | No | major parity gap |
| Insert Function dialog | No | function search/discovery weaker than Excel |
| Function arguments helper | No | argument editing assistance missing |
| Paste Special / formatting-only paste | No | common workflow gap |
| Robust external Excel paste fidelity | Partial | major migration friction |
| Keyboard context menu | No | mouse path exists, keyboard parity missing |
| Multi-range selection mode | No | advanced but familiar Excel behavior |
| Flash Fill | No | common on modern Excel workflows |
| Tell Me / command search | No | useful for discoverability and keyboard-driven users |

## Places Where UX Differs From Excel Even When Feature Exists

| Area | Difference today | Why it matters | Fix direction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AutoFilter | Present, but readback / state signal is not robust | feels less trustworthy and is harder to test | stable filter model exposure, clearer UI marker |
| Table creation | Works, but current test coverage treats it partly as smoke behavior | suggests the API/observable model is less stable than ideal | expose table state more directly |
| Print | Web-native print approximation, not true Excel page-layout fidelity | Excel users expect page setup to map closer to output | expand print rendering fidelity over time |
| Clipboard flows | Internal copy/paste is fine; desktop Excel HTML paste is incomplete | migration workflow pain | prioritize external clipboard compatibility |
| Command discovery | many commands exist only through menus or custom placements | Excel users rely on known dialogs and accelerators | add canonical dialogs and shortcut parity |

## Features That Set This Apart From Excel

These are positive product differences, not parity problems.

| Feature | Why it stands out | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real-time co-editing | Native multi-user collaboration is a major product differentiator | `tests/e2e/coedit.spec.ts`, `tests/e2e/coedit-share.spec.ts` |
| Share / password / view-only flows | More lightweight than desktop Excel sharing setups | `tests/e2e/coedit-share.spec.ts` |
| Autosave restore UX | Friendly browser-native recovery flow | `tests/e2e/autosave.spec.ts` |
| Responsive web shell | Better phone / tablet story than desktop Excel | `tests/e2e/mobile.spec.ts`, `tests/e2e/responsive-layout.spec.ts` |
| Side panels for charts / tables / outline | More app-like, discoverable web affordances | multiple panel E2Es |
| Rich xlsx sidecar strategy | Preserves charts/pivots/defined-names beyond plain ExcelJS baseline | `tests/e2e/xlsx-defined-names.spec.ts`, `tests/e2e/charts-p*.spec.ts`, `tests/e2e/pivots-p0.spec.ts` |

- `Ctrl+Shift+A`
- `Ctrl+Shift+V`
- `Ctrl+1`
- `Ctrl+E`
- `Shift+F8`

## Recommended Fix Order

### P0

1. External Excel paste fidelity
2. `Ctrl+1` Format Cells
3. `Ctrl+G` Go To

### P1

4. Insert Function dialog
5. Function argument helper
6. Paste Special / formatting-only paste
7. Multi-range selection

### P2

8. Re-apply filter
9. Keyboard context menu
10. Focus-zone navigation
11. Stabilize filter UX/read model
12. Flash Fill

### P3

13. Command palette / Tell Me

## Recommended Slice Plan

If this gets implemented as a series of small PRs, the most defensible order from here is:

1. Flash Fill
   Why first: it is the most visible remaining desktop-Excel convenience feature for single-user work.
   Exit criteria: simple pattern-based fills handle the common cases without requiring manual copy-down.

2. Residual keyboard-focus polish
   Why second: any remaining focus-zone issues should be treated as polish, not as a primary product lane.
   Exit criteria: no visible keyboard dead ends in the single-user shell.

3. Co-editing backlog
   Why third: once the single-user flows are coherent, collaboration-specific issues can be tackled without mixing concerns.
   Exit criteria: co-editing issues are broken into small, testable slices with explicit ownership.

## What Not To Chase Yet

These may be useful later, but they should not block the “normal Excel user feels at home” goal:

- full desktop-Excel dialog sprawl beyond the first `Ctrl+1` subset
- flash fill before clipboard and formatting parity are solid
- niche shortcut completion that does not affect the first 5 minutes of use
- page-layout perfection beyond the current print workflow unless output complaints become frequent

## Acceptance Checklist For The Top Gaps

Use this as the review bar for parity-focused PRs:

- Every new shortcut path has a dedicated E2E assertion, not just a smoke test.
- Keyboard and menu entry points land on the same command behavior.
- Dialogs restore focus predictably after close.
- New formatting UI maps onto the existing workbook model instead of creating a parallel state path.
- External clipboard fixes prove both visible UI outcome and underlying workbook state where practical.
- New parity work does not regress the existing side-panel, co-edit, or responsive shell strengths.

## Product Recommendation

If the explicit goal is “a normal Excel user should feel at home in the first 5 minutes,” the core single-user workflow is now mostly in place.

The remaining work should be judged against:

- flash fill for quick data cleaning
- any lingering keyboard-focus rough edges

Those are the last single-user behaviors that still stand out before moving to co-editing.

If the goal is “better than Excel for collaborative web work,” the product is already differentiated:

- co-editing
- sharing
- autosave recovery
- mobile/responsive behavior

The best strategy is not to copy all of Excel first. It is:

1. close the top muscle-memory gaps
2. keep the existing web-native strengths
3. avoid introducing heavy desktop-style complexity where a simpler web UX is already better
