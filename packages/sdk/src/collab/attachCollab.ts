/**
 * attachCollab — opt-in real-time co-editing for `<CasualSheets>`.
 *
 * The editor ships **collab-unaware**: it boots, edits, and persists with no
 * knowledge of rooms or peers. A host that wants co-editing calls
 * `attachCollab(api, { room, server })` once after `onReady` and gets back a
 * detach handle. That's the entire public surface — everything else (presence
 * UI, password prompts, room preflight, reconnect banners) is the host's to
 * build on top of the returned `provider` / `doc`.
 *
 * Transport: Yjs + Hocuspocus, exactly as the reference host (`apps/web`) uses
 * it. The non-negotiable Univer hooks live in `./bridge` — it subscribes to
 * `ICommandService.onMutationExecutedForCollab`, applies remote mutations with
 * `IExecutionOptions.fromCollab` (echo-loop prevention), and guards
 * `params.__splitChunk__`.
 *
 * Persistence note: Yjs/Hocuspocus is the **realtime transport only**. The
 * authoritative document is still saved by the host via WOPI / its own backend
 * (the save/exit event contract) — collab does not turn the SDK into a store.
