# casual sheets

A web-based, Excel-flavored spreadsheet editor with real-time collaboration on the roadmap. Built on [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer) (Apache-2.0 OSS).

The goal: feel like Excel, not like Google Sheets — ribbon, formula bar, file-centric workflow.

## Status

Phase 1 — single-user editor is feature-rich. Multi-user (Yjs + Hocuspocus) comes next.

| Working | Coming |
| --- | --- |
| Office-style ribbon (Home / Insert / Formulas / Data) | Real-time co-editing |
| Inline cell editing, F2, Backspace, Delete, Escape | Presence (cursors, avatars) |
| Formula bar with Name Box, fx, live mirror | More ribbon tabs (Review / View) |
| Fonts (family + size), colors, fill, wrap, alignment | Charts |
| Borders (split-button dropdown with 7 modes) | Pivot tables |
| Cell merge + unmerge | Print / PDF |
| AutoSum / Average / Count / Min / Max | WOPI host integration |
| Sort ascending/descending, Filter | |
| Open / Save As .xlsx (ExcelJS round-trip) | |
| Sheet tabs at the bottom (add / rename / delete / switch) | |
| Auto-fit column / row | |
| File menu with Properties dialog | |
| Dynamic workbook growth — 1024×128 → 8192×1024 | |
| Material Symbols icons, Inter typography | |

## Develop
