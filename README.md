**Live demo: <https://schnsrw.github.io/sheets/>** — auto-deployed from `main` on every push (CI → Pages).

A web-based, Excel-flavored spreadsheet editor with real-time collaboration on the roadmap. Built on [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer) (Apache-2.0 OSS).

The goal: feel like Excel, not like Google Sheets — ribbon, formula bar, file-centric workflow.

## Status

Phase 1 — single-user editor is feature-rich and locked down by 116 Playwright tests. Multi-user (Yjs + Hocuspocus) comes next.

- **CI** runs `lint`, `typecheck`, and the full Playwright suite on every PR and `main` push ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)).
- **Deploy** publishes `apps/web` to GitHub Pages on every `main` push ([`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)).
- **Tests**: 116 e2e specs in [`tests/e2e/`](./tests/e2e); xlsx / ods / csv / tsv round-trip, hyperlinks, drag-fill, drag-and-drop file open, formula evaluation, tables, freeze, comments, and more.
- **Live URL**: <https://schnsrw.github.io/sheets/>
