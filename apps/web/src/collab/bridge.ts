 * Yjs ↔ Univer mutation bridge. See docs/CO-EDITING.md for the design.
 *
 * Strategy: every non-collab mutation gets serialized into a Y.Array log;
 * peers replay each entry with `fromCollab: true`. The log is the source
 * of truth — late joiners read the whole array on connect via Yjs sync
 * and replay it once, ending up at the same state.
 *
 * Why an op log (not a state mirror): writing a per-mutation state mirror
 * for every mutation Univer emits (set-range-values, set-style, insert-row,
 * merge, hide-col, freeze, …) is dozens of handlers. The log generalizes
 * — any deterministic mutation just round-trips its params. Trade-off: no
 * per-cell CRDT merging on concurrent writes (Yjs orders inserts, then
 * Univer re-executes them; last writer wins at the mutation level). For
 * v1 that matches expectations.
 *
 * Echo-loop guard (per CLAUDE.md):
 *   - Records carry the emitter's `clientId`. The observer skips records
 *     it emitted itself (otherwise we'd double-apply our own writes).
 *   - Remote applies pass `fromCollab: true` so Univer's
 *     `onMutationExecutedForCollab` listener filters them back out via the
 *     options check below.
