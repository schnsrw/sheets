/**
 * `@casualoffice/sheets/collab` — opt-in real-time co-editing.
 *
 * The editor is collab-unaware until a host calls `attachCollab(api, opts)`.
 * Yjs + Hocuspocus is the realtime transport; authoritative persistence stays
 * host-side (WOPI / backend) via the save/exit event contract.
 *
 * Requires the host to provide `yjs` and `@hocuspocus/provider` (peer deps) so
 * there's a single Yjs instance in the graph — two copies break `Y.Doc`
 * identity and awareness.
