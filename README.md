**Live demo: <https://sheet.schnsrw.live/>** — auto-deployed from `main` on every push (CI → Pages).

A web-based, Excel-flavored spreadsheet editor with real-time collaboration on the roadmap. Built on [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer) (Apache-2.0 OSS).

The goal: feel like Excel, not like Google Sheets — ribbon, formula bar, file-centric workflow.

## Status

Phase 1 — single-user editor, feature-rich and locked down by 129 Playwright tests.
Phase 2 — real-time co-editing (Yjs + Hocuspocus + Redis persistence), shipped as a self-hosted Docker image.

- **CI** runs `lint`, `typecheck`, and the full Playwright suite on every PR and `main` push ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)).
- **Deploy** publishes `apps/web` to GitHub Pages on every `main` push ([`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml)).
- **Tests**: 129 e2e specs in [`tests/e2e/`](./tests/e2e); xlsx / ods / csv / tsv round-trip, hyperlinks, drag-fill, drag-and-drop file open, formula evaluation, tables, freeze, comments, and more.
- **Live URL**: <https://sheet.schnsrw.live/>

## Self-host with Docker

Single image. Web + Hocuspocus + Fastify in one container, Redis alongside
for room persistence so sessions survive restarts.

```sh
# Run the published image directly (in-memory rooms — fine for a quick try):
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 schnsrw/casual-sheets:latest
# open http://localhost:3000

# Or with persistence + Redis via compose:
docker compose up -d
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Co-edit a sheet: open `http://localhost:3000/r/<any-id>` in two browsers —
both join the same `Y.Doc`, edits propagate in <1 s. Anonymous, no login.

The same image is built and pushed from this repo. See
[`docs/CO-EDITING.md`](./docs/CO-EDITING.md) for the architecture and
[`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) / [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml)
for the deploy shape.

| Endpoint                 | What it does                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `GET  /`                 | Serves the built web app                    |
| `GET  /r/:roomId`        | Same SPA; bridges into the named Y.Doc      |
| `POST /api/rooms`        | Allocates a fresh empty room id             |
| `GET  /api/rooms`        | Diagnostic — live rooms + client counts     |
| `GET  /health`           | Liveness probe (returns `{ok, ts, rooms}`)  |
| `WS   /yjs`              | Hocuspocus Yjs sync                         |

| Env var          | Default | Meaning                                            |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`           | `3000`  | HTTP + WS port                                     |
| `HOST`           | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address                                     |
| `REDIS_URL`      | _unset_ | If set, Y.Docs persist to Redis with a 7-day TTL   |
| `ROOM_TTL_MIN`   | `5`     | Minutes a room stays in memory after the last client leaves |
