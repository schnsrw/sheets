/**
 * CasualSheetsAPI — the imperative ref handed to a host via `<CasualSheets onReady>`.
 *
 * This is the SDK's stable integration surface (Excalidraw's model: props +
 * imperative ref). Hosts drive the editor through these methods rather than
 * reaching into Univer directly; `api.univer` is the documented escape hatch and
 * is explicitly NOT covered by semver — everything else here is.
 *
 * Surface:
 *   getSnapshot / loadSnapshot / getSelection / executeCommand /
 *   executeCommands / onMutation / setTheme / importXlsx / exportXlsx / univer
 *
 * `importXlsx` / `exportXlsx` lazy-load the converters via
 * `import('@casualoffice/sheets/xlsx')` — a BARE subpath, not a relative
 * `import('../xlsx')`. The main tsup config is `splitting:false`, so a relative
 * dynamic import would be inlined and balloon the editor entry from ~24KB to
 * ~200KB of ExcelJS for hosts that never touch a file. The subpath is
 * externalised in tsup.config.ts so it stays a separate chunk the consumer
 * code-splits.
 *
 * `attachCollab` is NOT a method here — it ships as a standalone
 * `attachCollab(api, opts)` on the `@casualoffice/sheets/collab` subpath so the
 * editor stays collab-unaware (and collab-free in the bundle) until opted in.
