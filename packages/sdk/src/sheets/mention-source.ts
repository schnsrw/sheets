/**
 * Pluggable @mention data source for cell comments — pure layer.
 *
 * Univer's comment editor (the in-cell thread-comment popup) gets @-mention
 * autocomplete from `docs-mention-ui`, which lists candidates via the core
 * `IMentionIOService`. The default `MentionIOLocalService` is hardwired to a
 * single candidate — the current user — which is useless: you can't @mention
 * the people you're editing with.
 *
 * We override it with `CasualMentionIOService` (see `mention-io.ts`), which
 * reads candidates from a host-settable provider. The provider is the
 * pluggable seam the brief calls for:
 *   - embedded in another platform → the host sets it to its directory/users,
 *   - standalone → the app sets it to the live presence peers (+ self).
 *
 * This module is the @univerjs-value-free core (only `import type`, which is
 * erased at runtime) so it's unit-testable under the `node:test` + tsx runner,
 * which can't load @univerjs *value* modules. The enum-coupled service class
 * lives in `mention-io.ts`.
