/**
 * Formula calculation worker. Runs a stripped-down Univer in a Web Worker
 * so the main thread doesn't hang on large-workbook recalcs. The main
 * thread instance owns the data model + UI; this one only computes.
 *
 * Communication is via Univer's RPC plugins — UniverRPCMainThreadPlugin
 * on the main thread (wires the Worker) and UniverRPCWorkerThreadPlugin
 * here. Mutations flow over postMessage transparently to our code.
 *
 * The worker mirrors a minimal plugin set: SheetsPlugin (data model,
 * mutation-only mode), FormulaEnginePlugin (the actual calculator),
 * RemoteSheetsFormulaPlugin (the cross-boundary glue), FilterPlugin
 * (filter-aware formula evaluation, see Univer's reference worker).
