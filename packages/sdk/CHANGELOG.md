# @casualoffice/sheets

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 652068f: `CasualSheetsAPI.setTheme('light' | 'dark')` — imperative light/dark switch, the
  API equivalent of the reactive `appearance` prop. Flips Univer's
  `ThemeService.setDarkMode` (canvas colours + the `univer-dark` class Univer
  applies to the document root) via `api.setTheme(...)`, for hosts that drive the
  editor through the ref rather than re-rendering with a prop.
- f93fa6c: `<CasualSheets appearance="light" | "dark">` — reactive light/dark mode.

  Flipping it re-themes the live editor via Univer's `ThemeService.setDarkMode`
  (canvas colours, notifications, and Univer's `univer-dark` class). Distinct from
  the existing `theme` prop, which sets the Univer colour-theme object. Defaults to
  light. Note: Univer applies its dark CSS class to the document root, so dark mode
  is page-global by Univer's design.

- d3f9be6: SDK editor: working formula engine + a stable `CasualSheetsAPI` imperative ref.
  - **Formula engine now runs in embedding hosts.** The library entries
    (`index`/`sheets`/`xlsx`/`embed`/`univer`) externalise `@univerjs` so a host
    that already ships Univer no longer gets a second redi copy (which previously
    threw `[redi] loading scripts of redi more than once` and disabled the formula
    plugins). `<CasualSheets>` registers the formula engine + sheets-formula +
    numfmt and computes on the main thread.
  - **New `CasualSheetsAPI` imperative ref** handed to the host via
    `onReady(api)` — the SDK's stable integration surface:
    `getSnapshot()`, `loadSnapshot(data)`, `getSelection()`,
    `executeCommand(id, params?)`, and `api.univer` (the FUniver escape hatch,
    not covered by semver). `createCasualSheetsAPI` and the `CasualSheetsAPI` /
    `RangeRef` types are exported from `@casualoffice/sheets/sheets`.

  **Breaking:** `onReady` now receives a single `CasualSheetsAPI` argument
  instead of `(api: FUniver, univer: Univer)`. Migrate `onReady={(api) => …}`
  calls that used FUniver methods to `api.univer.<method>` (or the new
  first-class API methods where they exist, e.g. `api.executeCommand`).

  Deferred to follow-up batches: `importXlsx`/`exportXlsx` (xlsx-I/O batch),
  `setTheme` (runtime theme switch), `attachCollab` (collab adapter phase).

- 1da029e: `<CasualSheets>` now lazy-loads the feature plugins by default (`lazyPlugins`,
  default `true`): conditional formatting, data validation, hyperlinks, notes,
  tables, comments, drawings, sort, filter, and find/replace.

  Plugins whose data already lives in `initialData` (CF rules, tables, hyperlinks,
  …) load eagerly _before_ the workbook mounts, so opening a file never silently
  drops them; everything else idle-loads after first paint. This brings the SDK
  editor to feature parity with the app's grid without bloating the initial
  chunk — `@univerjs` feature packages stay external and load on demand.

  Pass `lazyPlugins={false}` for the minimal editor (render + formula + numfmt
  only); the embed-iframe runtime sets this to remain a single self-contained
  bundle.

- 2381fb4: `<CasualSheets onChange>` — a debounced stream of `IWorkbookData` snapshots.

  The "host persists it" half of the Excalidraw model: the editor stays
  storage-unaware and the host writes each snapshot wherever it likes
  (localStorage, server, …). Driven by Univer's mutation hook
  (`onMutationExecutedForCollab`), not UI events, so it captures every edit
  including programmatic ones. Debounce window is configurable via
  `onChangeDebounceMs` (default 400). Subscribed after the unit is created so
  the initial mount mutations don't emit a spurious first snapshot.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- Sheet toolbar v0.8: number formats, freeze, wrap.

  Adds to the `casual.command.execute` union:
  - `numfmt-currency`, `numfmt-percent` — single-tap apply
  - `numfmt-add-decimal`, `numfmt-subtract-decimal` — decimal stepper
  - `numfmt-custom { args.pattern }` — Excel-style pattern (e.g. `"d-mmm-yy"`, `"#,##0.00"`)
  - `wrap-toggle` — flip text wrap on the selection
  - `freeze-first-row`, `freeze-first-column`, `freeze-none` — header freezing

  All map onto canonical Univer command ids (`sheet.command.numfmt.set.currency`, `sheet.command.set-text-wrap`, `sheet.command.set-first-row-frozen`, etc.). No new format-state read-back yet — the host knows what it just dispatched, which is enough for v0.8's UX.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Sheet toolbar v0.7: rich format commands + read-back

  Adds to the `casual.command.execute` union (host → editor):
  - `set-font-family` ({ args.family })
  - `set-font-size` ({ args.size })
  - `set-text-color` / `reset-text-color` ({ args.color })
  - `set-bg-color` / `reset-bg-color` ({ args.color })
  - `merge` / `unmerge`

  Widens `SelectionFormatStateData` (editor → host) with `fontFamily`,
  `fontSize`, `textColor`, `bgColor` read off the active cell so hosts
  can keep font / size pickers + colour swatches in sync without polling
  Univer directly.

  Fixes the v0.6 strikethrough command id (the bad `set-range-strike-through`
  which doesn't exist; the canonical id is `set-range-stroke`).

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Host-controlled toolbar wire (UX-EDITOR-1):

  New protocol envelopes
  - `casual.command.execute { command }` — host → editor. Initial union: `undo | redo | bold | italic | underline | strikethrough | align-left | align-center | align-right`. Maps to the corresponding Univer command ids inside the iframe.
  - `casual.selection.format-state { bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, align }` — editor → host. Emitted on a 200 ms poll while the workbook is mounted so hosts can mirror the active cell's format flags in their toolbar's pressed state.

  CasualSheetsIframe ref gains `executeCommand(command)`. CasualSheetsIframeProps gains `onSelectionFormatState(data)`. Drive (or any host) can now render its own toolbar above the iframe and dispatch commands without needing Univer's built-in ribbon (which the SDK can't ship because the ribbon plugins require IRPCChannelService and no worker is bundled).

  Font / size / colour / fill / merge / row+column ops are intentionally NOT in v0.6 — they need a richer command-execute payload shape we haven't locked yet.

## 0.5.7

### Patch Changes

- embed-runtime: viewMode='editor' enables Univer's formula bar + menubar (A1 ref, fx, X/✓) so the embed is visually distinct from preview mode. Toolbar + footer stay off because their workbench-mount path resolves IRPCChannelService at construction (no worker bundled). Cells remain editable via direct keyboard input.

## 0.5.6

### Patch Changes

- Drop `UniverSheetsFormulaPlugin` + `UniverSheetsFormulaUIPlugin` from
  the CasualSheets plugin chain — they resolve `IRPCChannelService`
  via Univer's DI at construction, and with no
  `UniverRPCMainThreadPlugin` registered (the SDK doesn't bundle a
  formula worker) the resolve fails with the visible console error
  "[redi]: Expect 1 dependency item(s) for id IRPCChannelService".

  Cells stay editable; formula computation is the lost capability
  (already disabled in 0.5.x via `notExecuteFormula: true`). A future
  revision can let consumers opt in to a bundled formula worker.

  Also: embed-runtime passes a UI preset to `<CasualSheets ui={...}>`
  based on the `viewMode` URL param so preview mode renders just the
  canvas. Editor mode currently uses the same preset (the toolbar
  chrome requires sheets-ui plugins not yet bundled into the embed
  runtime — tracked for 0.6.x).

## 0.5.5

### Patch Changes

- Three fixes for end-to-end iframe rendering:
  1. embed-runtime imports `../styles` (Univer CSS) so injectStyle bundles
     Univer's stylesheet into the runtime. Without this the workbench
     mounted but rendered unstyled (canvas at 0×0).
  2. Emit `parser.worker.js` directly from the embedRuntimeConfig
     (alongside embed-runtime.js) instead of relying on a post-build
     copy from mainConfig — the configs run in parallel so the copy
     races and silently fails.
  3. CasualSheets passes `notExecuteFormula: true` to the formula
     plugins so the bundle doesn't hang waiting for an
     UniverRPCMainThreadPlugin formula worker that the SDK never
     registers.

## 0.5.4

### Patch Changes

- `noExternal: ['exceljs', /^@univerjs\//]` so the parser worker
  bundles @univerjs/core (it imports LocaleType + CustomRangeType).
  0.5.3 only added exceljs to noExternal; the worker still had
  `import { ... } from "@univerjs/core"` as a bare specifier and
  closed silently at load. The "OOM" error message the embed-runtime
  emitted was misleading — it was just an unresolvable bare import
  in a module-script worker.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- Three fixes to make the iframe embed actually render:
  1. `platform: 'browser'` on the main tsup config so the parser worker
     bundles exceljs's browser fork (no Node `stream` / `buffer` / `util`
     requires that broke worker init).
  2. embed-runtime calls `transport.sendReady()` after `sendHello()`. The
     host (CasualSheetsIframe) only sends its hello inside
     `onEditorReady`; without an eager `casual.ready` from the iframe,
     the handshake deadlocked and bytes never loaded.
  3. New tsup plugin copies `dist/parser.worker.js` into `dist/embed/`
     so the `new URL('./parser.worker.js', import.meta.url)` resolution
     inside the runtime finds the worker under `{embedBasePath}/`.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- Add `platform: 'browser'` to the embed-runtime tsup config so esbuild
  picks the browser variant of dual-target deps (nanoid, etc.). 0.5.1
  bundled everything but still grabbed `import { ... } from 'crypto'`
  from the Node fork of nanoid, which the browser can't resolve. The
  runtime now lands fully clean.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Bundle React + Univer + all deps into the embed-runtime instead of
  leaving them as external imports. The previous build expected the
  consumer to provide an importmap; consumers like Casual Drive that
  embed via `<iframe src="…/embed.html">` had no way to do that, and
  the bare `import 'react'` failed at runtime in the browser.

  The runtime now ships ~11MB self-contained (cached after first load).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- e044efd: Ship the SDK iframe-delivery architecture for sheets (Phase 2 of doc 16
  in the parent docx repo). Mirror of `@casualoffice/docs@1.1.0`.

  The existing `<CasualSheets>` direct-mount stays — no breaking change.
  Adds a new `<CasualSheetsIframe>` component that renders the editor
  inside a same-origin iframe. CSS isolation (Univer's design tokens
  stop bleeding into the host's tree), React-runtime isolation, and the
  Univer-vs-host font-cascade problems all go away when consumers
  switch from direct-mount to iframe.

  ### What the consumer-facing API looks like

  ```tsx
  import { CasualSheetsIframe } from '@casualoffice/sheets';

  <CasualSheetsIframe
    fileSource={{
      open: async (id) => ({ bytes, name, etag }), // host's bytes shim
    }}
    docId={file.id}
    viewMode="preview"             // or "editor"
    embedBasePath="/embed/sheets"   // defaults to /embed/sheets
    onSelectionChanged={…}
    onError={…}
  />;
  ```

  No iframe, no postMessage, no `EmbedTransport` wiring in the consumer.
  Bytes flow host → iframe via `casual.load.request` envelopes; inside
  the iframe the runtime parses xlsx → `IWorkbookData` via the SDK's
  own `xlsxToWorkbookData` (Phase A of #56) and mounts `<CasualSheets>`
  with the snapshot.

  ### Build artifacts

  Two new files in `dist/embed/`:
  - `embed-runtime.js` (132 KB self-contained ESM) — mounts the editor
    inside the iframe; loads xlsx bytes via the wire, converts, renders.
  - `embed.html` — the 1 KB static HTML document the iframe loads.

  Consumers copy these into their public dir at `embedBasePath` (default
  `/embed/sheets`). A Vite plugin that does the copy ships in v0.5.x;
  for v0.5.0 the contract is a two-line postinstall:

  ```sh
  mkdir -p web/public/embed/sheets
  cp node_modules/@casualoffice/sheets/dist/embed/* web/public/embed/sheets/
  ```

  ### Wire protocol additions
  - `casual.command.set.viewmode` — live preview ↔ editor toggle.
  - `casual.error` — editor → host fatal-error signal.

  Both mirror the docx repo's `13-iframe-protocol.md` extension.

  ### What's not in this minor
  - The full ref API (`flushSave`, `getSelection`, signing through iframe)
    — ships in v0.5.x once Drive proves the wire end-to-end.
  - The Vite plugin — v0.5.x.
  - Preview-mode chrome hiding inside the iframe — currently surfaced
    via `data-view-mode` attribute on the embed root + CSS gates in
    embed.html; v0.5.x wires the attribute to component-level `ui` props.
  - xlsx export from the iframe — Phase B of #56 still pending.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Ships the xlsx **import** path as `@casualoffice/sheets/xlsx` (Phase A of [#56](https://github.com/CasualOffice/sheets/issues/56)).

  ```ts
  import { xlsxToWorkbookData } from '@casualoffice/sheets/xlsx';

  const data = await xlsxToWorkbookData(arrayBuffer);
  // → IWorkbookData ready to mount via <CasualSheets initialData={data} />
  ```

  The parser runs in a Web Worker (`parser.worker.js`, bundled as a sibling
  in `dist/`). Consumer bundlers must support the
  `new Worker(new URL(...), import.meta.url)` pattern — Vite (with
  `worker.format: 'es'`), modern webpack with worker-plugin, esbuild's
  bundler.

  ### Fidelity scope
  - Values + formulas
  - Font (family, size, bold, italic, underline, colour)
  - Fill (solid background)
  - Alignment (horizontal, vertical, wrap)
  - Number format
  - Borders (thin, per side, colour preserved)
  - Merges
  - Sheet order + names
  - Tables, comments, data validation, page setup, named ranges (resources)

  Out of scope this release: charts, drawings, pivots, sparklines,
  advanced borders (dashed/double), themes, and **export** — Phase B of
  [#56](https://github.com/CasualOffice/sheets/issues/56) handles export once
  the outline / charts / pivots / sparklines extension-point design is
  settled.

  ### What apps/web changed
  - `apps/web/src/xlsx/{import,parse-in-worker,parser.worker,parse-impl}.ts`
    and the shared utilities (`style-mapping`, `constants`, all 5
    `*-resource.ts` files, `pivot-passthrough.ts`) **moved** into
    `packages/sdk/src/xlsx/`.
  - `apps/web/src/xlsx/{export,export-impl}.ts` now imports the shared
    mappers + resource readers from `@casualoffice/sheets/xlsx`. Same
    code, new path.
  - `apps/web/src/xlsx/index.ts` re-exports `xlsxToWorkbookData` from the
    SDK so existing apps/web call-sites are unaffected.

  ### Shared internals

  The SDK's `./xlsx` entry exports the shared style mappers + resource
  readers in addition to the importer. Hosts that ship their own xlsx
  export path (Casual Sheets' apps/web is one) use them to stay in
  lockstep with this importer's shape. Consumers that only need import
  ignore them — tree-shaking strips the unused symbols.

  ### Drive unblock

  [`CasualOffice/drive`](https://github.com/CasualOffice/drive) can now replace the
  `CasualSheetWorkspace` placeholder with a real loader:

  ```tsx
  const bytes = await driveFileSource.open(file.id);
  const data = await xlsxToWorkbookData(bytes);
  <CasualSheets initialData={data} ... />;
  ```

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 73e693f: Ships `CasualSheets` — a React wrapper around Univer Sheets. Mounts a
  workbook from `initialData`, boots the eager plugin set (render +
  formula engine + UI + docs + sheets + sheets-ui + sheets-formula +
  numfmt), and surfaces the `FUniver` API to the host via `onReady`.
  Hosts (Casual Drive in particular) can now `import { CasualSheets }
from '@casualoffice/sheets/sheets'` and drop in a working
  spreadsheet view without re-implementing the boot dance.

  Lazy plugins (CF, drawings, sort, filter, hyperlinks, tables,
  comments, find/replace), the formula web worker, snapshot swap, and
  facade extensions stay app concerns — hosts layer them on top of
  `FUniver` after `onReady`.

  Also adds `./styles` (`import '@casualoffice/sheets/styles'`) as a
  side-effect entry that brings in the eager plugin CSS in one line.

  Univer 0.24.x packages move to peer dependencies (all optional, all
  declared in `peerDependenciesMeta`).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 06a5f3a: Initial release: `@casualoffice/sheets` SDK shipping the signing pipeline
  (drawn / typed / uploaded signature surfaces, sequential / concurrent modes)
  and the iframe postMessage protocol (`EmbedTransport`, `casual.*` envelope
  types). Wire shapes are byte-identical to `@casualoffice/docs` — only
  the `app` discriminator (`'sheet'` vs `'docs'`) and signature anchor shape
  (`{ kind: 'sheet', sheet, cell }` vs `{ kind: 'doc', paraId }`) differ. The
  Univer-Sheets React wrapper (`CasualSheets` component) is planned for a
  follow-up release.
