/**
 * Comment authorship store — who wrote each comment.
 *
 * Univer's thread comments stamp `personId` from the *current user*
 * (`UserManagerService`). We can't set a distinct current user per client:
 * `setCurrentUser` feeds Univer's permission layer, and a non-default user id
 * flips the collab grid to read-only (the #122 regression). So every client
 * shares the empty default `personId` and comments carry no usable author.
 *
 * Instead we record authorship out-of-band, keyed by comment id, exactly like
 * charts ride their own Y.Map alongside the cell-mutation op-log:
 *   - the *creating* client stamps `commentId → {name,color}` from its own
 *     presence identity (the only client that runs the add-comment **command**;
 *     peers only receive the replicated mutation),
 *   - in a room that stamp is mirrored into a `casual-comment-authors` Y.Map so
 *     peers resolve the name,
 *   - single-player just keeps the local map (author = the local display name).
 *
 * This module is the transport-agnostic store. CollabDriver owns the stamping
 * hook + Y.Map mirror; CommentsPanel subscribes for render.
