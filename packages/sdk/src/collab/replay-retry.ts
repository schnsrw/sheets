 * Decide whether a replay error is worth retrying.
 *
 * Transient class: dynamic-import / chunk-load failures. These come
 * from the lazy-plugin gate fetching a webpack chunk over the
 * network; a flap on the user's connection drops the fetch and the
 * lazy `import()` rejects with one of several distinct shapes:
 *
 *   - Webpack 5: `ChunkLoadError` with name === 'ChunkLoadError'
 *   - Webpack 4 / vite: 'Loading chunk N failed.'
 *   - Vite / native ESM: 'Failed to fetch dynamically imported module'
 *   - Native fetch under offline: 'NetworkError when attempting to fetch'
 *
 * All four resolve on retry once the network recovers. Everything
 * else (executeCommand rejections from bad params, missing handlers,
 * out-of-bounds ranges) is permanent — retrying just burns the same
 * stack trace N more times.
 *
 * Conservative bias: when in doubt, classify permanent. A false
 * negative (transient → permanent) costs us a dead-letter entry the
 * user can re-trigger by reloading; a false positive (permanent →
 * transient) wastes 4 s of retries on a known-broken mutation.
